major-version gem upgrade you've ever done. To assist with that process, we've developed
RSpec 2.99 in tandem with RSpec 3. Every breaking change in 3.0 has a corresponding
deprecation to 2.99.  Rather than just giving you a generic upgrade document that describes
<em>all</em> of the breaking changes (most of which affect very few users!), RSpec 2.99 gives you a
detailed upgrade checklist tailored to your project.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://twitter.com/nkym37">Yuji Nakayama</a> has created <a href="http://yujinakayama.me/transpec/">Transpec</a> – an absolutely amazing tool that can
automatically upgrade most RSpec suites. We've tried it on a few projects and have been <em>amazed</em> at how well it works.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step-instructions">Step-by-step Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure your test suite is already green on whatever RSpec 2.x version
you're already using.</li>
  <li>Install RSpec 2.99.</li>
  <li>Run your test suite and ensure it's still green. (It should be, but
we may have made a mistake – if it breaks anything, please report
a bug!). Now would be a good time to commit.</li>
  <li>You'll notice a bunch of deprecation warnings printed off at the
end of the spec run. These may be truncated since we don't to
spam you with the same deprecation warning over and over again. To
get the full list of deprecations, you can pipe them into a file
by passing the <code>--deprecation-out path/to/file</code> option.</li>
  <li>If you want to understand all of what is being deprecated, it's a
good idea to read through the deprecation messages.  In some cases,
you have choices – such as continuing to use the <code>have</code> collection
cardinality matchers via the extracted
<a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec-collection_matchers">rspec-collection_matchers</a>
gem, or by rewriting the expectation expression to something like
<code>expect(list.size).to eq(3)</code>.</li>
  <li><code>gem install transpec</code> (Note that this need not go into your
<code>Gemfile</code>: you run <code>transpec</code> as a standalone executable
 outside the context of your bundle).</li>
  <li>Run transpec on your project. Check <code>transpec --help</code> or
<a href="https://github.com/yujinakayama/transpec#transpec">the README</a>
for a full list of options.</li>
  <li>Run the test suite (it should still be green but it's always good to
check!) and commit.</li>
  <li>If there are any remaining deprecation warnings (transpec doesn't
quite handle all of the warnings you may get), deal with them.</li>
  <li>Once you've got a deprecation-free test suite running against RSpec
2.99, you're ready to upgrade to RSpec 3. Install RSpec 3.</li>
  <li>Run your test suite. It should still be green. If anything fails,
please open a Github issue – we consider it a bug! Note
that you may still get a few additional deprecation warnings on
RSpec 3 that weren't present on 2.99.  This is normal – there are
a few things we couldn't easily deprecate in 2.99 and remove in 3.0,
so they trigger deprecations in 3.0 with the plan to remove them in
RSpec 4.</li>
  <li>We recommend running <code>transpec</code> a second time. There are some
changes that transpec is only able to make when your project is on
RSpec 3.</li>
  <li>Commit and enjoy using the latest RSpec release!</li>
